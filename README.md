# smartbusiness-test-task


I implemented this database as a solution for this test task as a nice way to demonstrate my experience with SQL and RDBMS. This database can be used to manage the core functionalities of an e-commerce store's order management system, providing an organized and efficient structure to handle interactions between customers, products, orders, and addresses. I implemented the database using PostgresQL. THe code and example queries you can find in `order_management_system.sql` file. The diagram describing tables and relations between them is shown below.
